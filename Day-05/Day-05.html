### CSS Box Model

The CSS Box Model describes how elements are structured and how their content, padding, border, and margin are calculated and rendered. Here's a breakdown of each component:

1. **Content**: The actual content of the element, such as text, images, etc.
2. **Padding**: The space between the content and the element's border.
3. **Border**: The border surrounding the padding and content.
4. **Margin**: The space outside the border, which separates this element from other elements.

<!--
Let's create an HTML file with a simple example to illustrate the CSS Box Model:
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="Day-05.css">
    <title>Css Box Model Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class='box'>
        this is content of the box</div>
    
</body>
</html>


<!--
#### Explanation:

In the above code:

- We have a `<div>` element with the class "box". This is our box.
- We've set its width, height, padding, border, margin, and background color using CSS.
- The `padding`, `border`, and `margin` properties are all influencing the size and spacing of our box.
- The content of the box is just a simple text.

### "overflow" Property in CSS

The "overflow" property in CSS controls what happens when content overflows its box. It can have the following values:

- **visible**: Default. Content is not clipped and may be rendered outside the box.
- **hidden**: Content that overflows the box is hidden.
- **scroll**: Adds a scrollbar to the box to scroll the content that overflows.
- **auto**: Similar to scroll, but the scrollbar is only added when needed.

#### Example:

Let's modify our previous example to demonstrate the "overflow" property:
-->


<div class="box">
  This is some long content that will overflow the box.
</div>

<!--

#### Explanation:

In this example, by setting `overflow: hidden;`, any content that overflows the box will be hidden. Try changing this value to "visible", "scroll", or "auto" to see how it affects the overflow behavior.

These examples should give you a good starting point to understand the CSS Box Model and the "overflow" property. Feel free to experiment with different values and properties to further enhance your understanding!
