    <div class="wrap-container">
        <div class="wrap-item">burger 1</div>
        <div class="wrap-item">burger 2</div>
        <div class="wrap-item">burger 3</div>
    </div>

        In this example:

The container uses flex-direction: row, justify-content: space-between, align-items: center, and flex-wrap: wrap.
Each item is given a base size of 200px with flex-basis, and they can grow (flex-grow: 1) and shrink (flex-shrink: 1) as needed.
The first item is set to appear last with order: 2.
These examples should give you a good foundation to start experimenting with Flexbox in your own layouts!
