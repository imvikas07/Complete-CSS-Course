One of the most important keywords in CSS is display. The display property determines how an HTML element is displayed on the webpage. It's a fundamental aspect of CSS as it governs the layout of elements. Here's a brief explanation along with an example:
n this example, we have three <div> elements with the class box, each styled to have a width, height, background color, and border. However, they differ in how they're displayed due to the value of the display property:
***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
The first div has a display property set to block. Block-level elements take up the full width available and start on a new line. So, this div behaves like a block-level element.
The second div has a display property set to inline. Inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line. So, this div behaves like an inline-level element.
The third div has a display property set to inline-block. Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements, but they can have a width and height set. They also respect top and bottom margins, and padding, unlike inline elements. So, this div behaves like an inline-block level element.
Understanding and mastering the display property is crucial for controlling the layout of elements on a webpage.
