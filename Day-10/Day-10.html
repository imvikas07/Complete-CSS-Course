<!--
    Let's start by explaining the different CSS positioning properties: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky.
-->
<!--

1. **Static Positioning**: This is the default position for all elements. An element with `position: static;` is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. This means it will appear in the order it is written in the HTML, without any special positioning.

2. **Relative Positioning**: An element with `position: relative;` is positioned relative to its normal position. This means you can use the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties to move the element from where it would normally be placed.

3. **Absolute Positioning**: An element with `position: absolute;` is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the `<body>`). This allows you to precisely position an element anywhere on the page.

4. **Fixed Positioning**: An element with `position: fixed;` is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. This is often used for things like headers or navigation bars that you want to stay visible at all times.

5. **Sticky Positioning**: An element with `position: sticky;` is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It behaves like `position: relative;` until a specified offset threshold is met, then it "sticks" to a specified position. This is useful for creating elements like sticky headers or sidebars.

Now, let's demonstrate each of these positions with some simple HTML and CSS:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="Day-10.css">
  <title>CSS Positioning Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <!-- Boxes with different positioning -->
    <div class="box static">Static</div>
    <div class="box relative">Relative</div>
    <div class="box absolute">Absolute</div>
    <div class="box fixed">Fixed</div>
    <div class="box sticky">Sticky</div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>


In this code:

- Each `.box` div represents an element with different positioning.
- `.relative` is positioned relative to its normal position with a 20px offset from the top and left.
- `.absolute` is positioned absolutely with a fixed position 50px from the top and left of the nearest positioned ancestor (or the initial containing block).
- `.fixed` is positioned fixedly 10px from the top and right of the viewport.
- `.sticky` is initially positioned relative to its normal position, but once it reaches the top of the viewport during scrolling, it sticks to the top.
